PS3BluMote Release Notes

PS3BluMote has been partially coded by miljbee with the great help of the InTheHand.Net libraries.
Please read the InTheHand.Net.Licence.txt file.

The original PS3BluMote App was initially coded by BenBarron http://benbarron.com/applications
I have added the hibernation Code.
The method used is the same as the one used by PS3RemoteSleep from riaanc http://ps3remotesleep.codeplex.com/

Concerning my code, do what you want with it, but please, be kind enough to mention me, or to send me your work or improvements.
The source code is available on GitHub : https://github.com/miljbee/PS3BluMote

The usual warnings applies, do what you want with that, but don't expect any support from me, even if it blows your hardware.
If you feel generous, my paypal account is miljbee@gmail.com

Ver. 2.2 partially coded by gridgem

[New Features]
- add multiple key mappings (assigned by active window title)
- add setting key mappings from keyboard (except some keys)
- add OSD (On-Screen Display)

[Changes]
- change ini file format.
- change key names ("Left_Menu" to "Left_Alt", "Right_Menu" to "Right_Alt").
- disable multiple starts.

[About multiple mappings]
The key mapping is selected by the active window title.
It tries to match from the top of the list ("Settings" tab, "Mappings" area) 
to bottom.
You can use regular expression ("regex") to the condition.

Once the active window title is matched to a mapping condition,
it does NOT pass through down to next mapping even there's no key assign.
For example, a mapping which has the condition as ".*" is middle of the list
(".*" matches any strings including empty string), mappings under the mapping
will NEVER be matched.

Be careful to the default mapping "General" which condition is ".*".

[About keyboard input]
You can set key settings from the keyboard except some keys and combinations.
If you want to set keys which isn't on your keyboard, you can use checkboxes
as same as before.

You can't set keys below from the keyboard.
Enter, Delete, Back Space, Arrow Up and Arrow Down.
(These keys move focus or delete foucused setting.)

And some key combinations (like Ctrl + Alt + Del) will not be prevented.

[About OSD (On-Screen Display)]
OSD is always inactive, though it's shown generally top the most.
It does not steal the focus and you can't click or drag.
I couldn't display OSD over ALL applications (like Task Manager or some 
full screen aplication like XBMC).

When you use animation, showing time will be extended for the time to animate.
If you set "Time to display text" as 2200 (2.2 seconds) and "Time to animate" 
as 400 (0.4 seconds), OSD displays for 3 seconds (3000 milli-seconds) because 
it is the sum of 400 (show animate) + 2200 ("Time to display text") + 400 
(disappear animate).

[About ini file]
I can't help changing ini file format.
For the first time you execute this version (2.2), it tries to convert ini file
to preserve mappings you have set.
The original ini file will be renamed as "settings2.0.ini" on the same folder
 (and it shows dialog).
C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Local\PS3BluMote

[About version number]
I set it as 2.2.0 because miljbee's version displays as 2.1.0.
(Though I know it is known as 2.0.4 and internally set property as so.)

[About hibernation]
I didn't touch the function (It works very well for me).
